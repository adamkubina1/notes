As atomic as possible
Instead of sequentially make them conceptual 
Linking ideas together, adding to old notes, creating new notes
	When adding something
		Does it connect to something I already know?
Do not note variables (like height of something), that are easy to look up
	Do not even try to memorize it
Notes are for me they do not have to be memorable by other people
Not necessary to organize by folders link are enough - also I would use tags for courses or todos


First principles thinking
Zettelkasten system
Active externalism

Technique for notes from books - read the whole thing and tag areas that look note worthy, then go back through it after finishing it.
